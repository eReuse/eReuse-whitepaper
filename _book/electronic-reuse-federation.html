<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Electronic Reuse Federation</h1>
<p>Ereuse.org is a cluster of organisations dedicated to the transition to collaborative and circular consumption of electronics. We motivate and promote the emergence of local autonomous open platforms to reuse electronics that ensure final recycling and verifiable assessment of reuse impact. The eReuse federated members are mainly social economy organizations that refurbish, recycle and distribute second-hand devices such as mobiles, laptops or desktop computers. In cities, federated members and city councils collaborate and coordinate in reuse circuits with great effect in creating inclusive jobs, starting or accelerating efficiency and scaling up of local exchange/market of second hand devices. Ereuse.org was launched in 2015, we are a project under Pangea.org, a private, independent non-profit organization founded in 1993 to promote the strategic and environmental use of ICT.</p>
<div id="mission" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Mission</h2>
<p>Most devices from business and public administration are discarded when considered amortized, and although they still have a value for use and are suitable for reuse, they are scrapped (recycled), or illegally exported to other countries via informal reuse circuits. The positive aspects of reuse are well understood, reuse effectively contributes to develop a circular economy, strengthen the creation of local employment, prevent the generation of waste, and reduce the digital divide. However, why is it such a minority practice? When companies, governments or individuals need to get rid of their computers and digital devices to have a new life (reuse), they don’t know where to turn. This results in most Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE) being recycled even though the explicit demand for reuse. Public authorities and business are willing to promote the positive aspects of reuse, but without a traceability solution and a commitment from consumers for reused products, it is uncertain if reused digital devices may end up being exported illegally and potentially polluting the environment. Such risk and slippage is the main drawback in the promotion and the practice of reuse in public and private organisations.</p>
<p>Ereuse.org’s mission is bootstap an ecosystem capable of avoiding the premature recycling of electronics. We motivate and promote the emergence of local autonomous open platforms to reuse electronics that ensure final recycling and verifiable assessment of reuse impact. We cooperate to help to sustain and grow ecosystems that increase reuse and recycling and together we build a new mindset and open-source tech to make reuse/recycling tech industry more durable, reusable, repairable and impact accountable. The coalition of members and collaborators bring together the skills, training and open technologies necessary to help sustain and grow federated and autonomous platforms that optimize refurbishment, ensure quality of second hand electronics products and bring management in the reverse supply chain to incentivitize reused devices are ultimately recycled and impact accountable.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Our activity</h2>
<div id="bootstraping-circular-economy-ecosystems" class="section level3" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Bootstraping circular economy ecosystems</h3>
<p>In a circular and collaborative economy ecosystem people and organizations improve and exchange electronic devices to avoid premature recycling. The coalition of members and partners exchange know-how, build connections and bring together the skills and training to help sustain and grow federated and autonomous ecosystems that optimize refurbishment, ensure quality of second hand electronics products and bring management in the reverse supply chain to incentivitize reused devices are ultimately recycled and impact accountable. We coordinate and promote the creation of local circuits where several entities intercooperate under different roles to capture, refurbish and redistribute devices with a quality certificate to, among others, citizens affected by digital inequality.</p>
</div>
<div id="accredits-circularity-of-members-and-federated-ecosystems" class="section level3" number="2.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Accredits circularity of members and federated ecosystems</h3>
<p>Circular consumption is based on using resources to the maximum extent possible, ensuring that they are ultimately recycled, but never before or prematurely, but only when no one else can be used or reused. Business disposing digital devices choose members with accountable reusability and recycling performance. The challenge is to provide resources for consumers, members and federated platforms to self-assess, self-certify and share this data with a data-commons for circularity. eReuse accredits circular economy entities that trace devices throughout their useful life and account for the sustainability impact generated. Together we want to achieve and measure the three impacts of a circular economy: economic, environmental and social, advancing towards the objectives SDG 16, 13, 12, 15, 4 and 10.</p>

<div id="coordinate-open-source-resources-roadmap-for-reusing-electronics" class="section level3" number="2.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3</span> Coordinate open-source resources roadmap for reusing electronics</h3>
<p>Our members and partners develops and share open-source resources such as refurbishment tools, inventory management, product passport traceability systems, self-accreditation mechanisms for quality and circularity standards, good practices and case studies. Together we build a new mindset and open-source tech to make reuse/recycling tech industry more durable, reusable, repairable and impact accountable. The challenge in this activity is to prioritize which resources are key to the community and ensure they are open-source and based on open standards.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.2</span> Zero Waste Europe</h4>
<p>ZWE brings together and represents the European municipalities that have openly committed to the goal of continuously reducing waste generation and improving waste separate collection and hence redesigning the relationship between people and waste. We are defining a campaign for municipalities with the objective of to increase the number of municipalities willing to promote the circular economy of digital devices. With the help of ZWE we want to find interested municipalities, local zero waste organizations willing to launch local reuse circuits and social reuse centers that repair, refurbish and retail second hand used digital devices.</p>

<p>The Distributed Systems Group at upc.edu performs research on distributed systems and computer networks in the areas of models, algorithms and software for large, complex, dynamic, decentralized systems and applications. We look at large scale and decentralized community networks and community clouds, economics oriented distributed systems, and resource allocation mechanisms. Activities are around the design, modelling and evaluation of systems through modelling and experimentation in real deployments. Outcomes are system architectures, algorithms, software, regulation and adaptive models, decentralized resource allocation and game-theory based mechanisms. The group consists of four professors and a variable number of PhD and master students.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.6</span> Usody</h4>
<p>Usody is a B2B tracing solution to measure &amp; optimize the circular economy impact of digital devices. Business disposing or selling digital devices such as mobiles, desktops and laptops are not taking advantage of the circular economy and social impact they generate. We anonymous trace the reverse-chain of ownership custody, and report data to assess social and environmental impact of reuse and final recycling, generating trust to enable public administrations and companies to offer their devices for reuse to resellers. However the resellers do not feel comfortable in openly sharing this traceability data. They fear competitors, or they might even be penalized, if one of their devices is not properly recycled at the end of its life. For that reason a privacy-preserving distributed ledger technology (DLT) system is used to ensure trust. We differentiate from others by providing traceability &amp; impacting accounting as a stand-alone service that can be used by existing resellers. Resellers are our partners, not competition, and we enable them to provide impact accounting.</p>
