abstract = {(PREFACE) - The circular economy is a vision for a future economy that provides for the needs and wants of society within healthy planetary boundaries. Currently, however, this remains only a vision: our current linear economy upsets the balance between the economy and nature. Although this is unsustainable, it continues to accelerate. This report describes how businesses can measure an indication of circularity of their organisation, product or value chain, and how they can use that information to create or transform to a more sustainable—and circular—business model. Ultimately, this report provides the guidance needed for change agents to select the most suitable metric to measure, and fast-track, circularity in their organisation. ... ... ...},

@article{Mugge2017,
abstract = {As smartphones are being replaced at an increasing rate, it becomes more and more important to find ways to reuse (parts of) existing phones. This research investigates the potential of selling refurbished smartphones using a quantitative study. An online survey was conducted questioning 250 respondents, in which the perceived consumer risks and benefits associated with refurbished phones were investigated. Furthermore, we studied the impact of various incentives that companies can employ to improve consumers' purchase intention of refurbished phones. Through a cluster analysis six distinct customer groups were identified. Our sample demonstrated a positive attitude towards refurbished smartphones, with most potential for three out of our six customer groups (46% of our sample). This indicates that refurbished smartphones can be a market success. It was found that perceived environmental benefits and awareness of refurbishing have a positive impact on the consumers' purchase intention for refurbished smartphones. Most of the highest scoring incentives for purchasing refurbished smartphones were product-related and included improved battery life, guaranteed software updates and upgraded performance, indicating a need for continued performance. This research contributes to our theoretical understanding of consumer responses to refurbished smartphones and can help companies in launching these products successfully.},

   abstract = {Lifespan is an essential parameter for the accounting and analysis of material stocks and flows, one of the main research topics in industrial ecology. Lifespan is also important as a parameter that portrays the current and historical situation of industrial metabolism, which is an area of interest to industrial ecologists. In the present article, the available information from various reports on product lifespan was reviewed. Although we found a large number of data for many durables, the definition of lifespan in published articles varied, which limited our ability to compare reported values. We therefore first defined lifespan and then compared the international and historical data. We compiled more than 1,300 data sets from various sources and identified some differences among the types of goods and among regions. With the reviewed data noted in this article, we established a database, named LiVES (Lifespan Database for Vehicles, Equipment, and Structures), and will disclose it on the Internet to share the information. © 2010 by Yale University.},

abstract = "In this paper, we consider the problem of cloud market share among Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers in a competitive setting. The public cloud market is dominated by few large providers, which prevents a healthy competition that would benefit the end-users. We argue that to make the cloud market more competitive, new providers, even small ones, should be able to inter this market and find a share. This problem of deeply analyzing the cloud market and providing new players with mechanisms allowing them to have a market share has not been addressed yet. In fact, to make the cloud market open and increase the cloud service demand, we show in this paper that the cloud providers have to compete not only over price, but also quality. Most of the research performed in the cloud market competition focus only on pricing mechanisms, neglecting thus the cloud service quality and user’s satisfaction. However, to be consistent with the new era of cloud computing, Cloud 2.0, providers have to focus on providing value to businesses and offer higher quality services. As a solution to the aforementioned problem, we propose a conceptual, user-centric game theoretical framework that includes a two-stage game: 1) to capture the user demand preferences (optimal capacity and price), a Stackelberg game is used where IaaS providers are leaders and IaaS users are followers; and 2) to enhance the service ratings given by users in order to improve the provider position in the market and increase the future users’ demand, a differential game is proposed, which allows IaaS providers to compete over service quality (e.g., QoS, scalability and adding extra features). The proposed two-stage game model allows the new IaaS providers, even if they are small, to have a share in the market and increase user’s satisfaction through providing high quality and added-value services. To validate the theoretical analysis, experimental results are conducted using a real-world cloud service quality feedback, collected by the CloudArmor project. This research reveals that due to the fact that service customization tends to enhance the customers loyalty in today’s subscription cloud economy, the best strategy for small IaaS providers is to increase the service cost and improve the quality of their added-value solutions to prevent customers’ defection. This not only elevates the provider’s profit, but also increases the quality equilibrium that leads to a higher user satisfaction. Consequently, higher satisfaction enhances the provider’s rating and future users demand."

Not only have more providers and service offerings crowded the space, but also cloud infrastructure that was traditionally limited to single provider data centers is now evolving. In this paper, we firstly discuss the changing cloud infrastructure and consider the use of infrastructure from multiple providers and the benefit of decentralising computing away from data centers. These trends have resulted in the need for a variety of new computing architectures that will be offered by future cloud infrastructure. These architectures are anticipated to impact areas, such as connecting people and devices, data-intensive computing, the service space and self-learning systems. Finally, we lay out a roadmap of challenges that will need to be addressed for realising the potential of next generation cloud systems."

	Abstract = {LHCb has introduced a novel real-time detector alignment and calibration strategy for LHC Run II. Data collected at the start of the fill is processed in a few minutes and used to update the alignment, while the calibration constants are evaluated for each run. The procedure aims to improve the quality of the online selection and performance stability. The required computing time constraints are met thanks to a new dedicated framework using the multi-core farm infrastructure for the trigger. A similar scheme is planned to be used for Run III foreseen to start in 2020. At that time LHCb will run at an instantaneous luminosity of 2 x 10 33 cm -2 s -1 and a fully software based trigger strategy will be used. The new running conditions and the tighter timing constraints in the software trigger (only 13 ms per event are available) represent a big challenge for track reconstruction. The new software based trigger strategy implies a full detector read-out at the collision rate of 40 MHz. High performance and timing constraints are ensured by a new tracking system and a fast and efficient track reconstruction strategy.},

abstract = "Recently, a promising trend has evolved from previous centralized computation to decentralized edge computing in the proximity of end-users to provide cloud applications. To ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) of such applications and Quality of Experience (QoE) for the end-users, it is necessary to employ a comprehensive monitoring approach. Requirement analysis is a key software engineering task in the whole lifecycle of applications; however, the requirements for monitoring systems within edge computing scenarios are not yet fully established. The goal of the present survey study is therefore threefold: to identify the main challenges in the field of monitoring edge computing applications that are as yet not fully solved; to present a new taxonomy of monitoring requirements for adaptive applications orchestrated upon edge computing frameworks; and to discuss and compare the use of widely-used cloud monitoring technologies to assure the performance of these applications. Our analysis shows that none of existing widely-used cloud monitoring tools yet provides an integrated monitoring solution within edge computing frameworks. Moreover, some monitoring requirements have not been thoroughly met by any of them."

  abstract={Universal connectivity is still unavailable or expensive for half of the global population, despite being critical for social participation. The deployment of crowdsourced networking infrastructures creates an opportunity for local development, where anyone can deploy a new device. In such infrastructures connectivity offer can expand incrementally and be sustainable through investment and fees resulting from the demand and consumption of content and services, including Internet access, that compensate the cost of the underlying network. While routing coordinates network data flows, economic flows can be coordinated by smart contracts built over a local distributed ledger. We define crowdsourced networks, the concept, architecture, and implementation using a local Ethereum PoA blockchain with Solidity smart contracts that compensate the data traffic contribution and consumption recorded by a traffic monitoring system, on a wireless mesh network. The prototype software has been validated in a controlled mesh network environment. Functional tests show its ability to account and route economic flows with small resource consumption, and therefore confirms these networks can develop organically by the addition of consumer and provider participants to reach the typical scale of most wireless mesh access networks and deliver networking services that aim to be socially and economically sustainable.}

The relationship between the concepts is not made explicit in literature, which is blurring their conceptual contours and constrains the efficacy of using the approaches in research and practice. This research addresses this gap and aims to provide conceptual clarity by distinguishing the terms and synthesising the different types of relationships between them. We conducted an extensive literature review, employing bibliometric analysis and snowballing techniques to investigate the state of the art in the field and synthesise the similarities, differences and relationships between both terms. We identified eight different relationship types in the literature and illustrated the most evident similarities and differences between both concepts."

In this paper, specific attention is paid to renewable energy technologies (RETs) for electricity and heat generation and reviews current understanding and estimates of life cycle GHG emissions from a range of renewable electricity and heat generation technologies. Comprehensive literature reviews for each RET were carried out. The 79 studies reviewed involved the life cycle assessment (LCA) of renewable electricity and heat generation based on onshore and offshore winds, hydropower, marine technologies (wave power and tidal energy), geothermal, photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal, biomass, waste, and heat pumps. The study demonstrates the variability of existing LCA studies (results) in tracking GHG emissions for electricity and heat generation from RETs. This review has shown that the lowest GHG emissions were associated with offshore wind technologies (mean life cycle GHG emissions could be 5.3–13gCO2eq/kWh). Results compared with GHG estimates by fossil fuel heat and electricity indicated that life cycle GHG emissions are comparatively higher in conventional sources as compared to renewable sources with the exception of nuclear-based power electricity generation. In this present study, considering renewable energy sources, waste treatment and dedicated biomass technologies (DBTs) were found to potentially have high GHG emissions based on the feedstock, selected boundary and the inputs required for their production. The study identifies additional impacts associated with renewable electricity and heat technologies, points out the effectiveness of life cycle analysis (LCA) as a tool for assessing environmental impacts of renewable energy sources and concludes with opportunities for improvement in the future."

        abstract = {Purpose: To explore the literature surrounding the environmental impact of mobile phones and the implications of moving from the current business model of selling, using and discarding phones to a product service system based upon a cloud service. The exploration of the impacts relating to this shift and subsequent change in scope is explored in relation to the life cycle profile of a typical smartphone. Methods: A literature study is conducted into the existing literature in order to define the characteristics of a {\textquotedblleft}typical{\textquotedblright} smartphone. Focus is given to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different life cycle phases in line with that reported in the majority of literature. Usage patterns from literature are presented in order to show how a smartphone is increasingly responsible for not only data consumption, but also data generation. The subsequent consequences of this for the balance of the life cycle phases are explored with the inclusion of wider elements in the potential expanded mobile infrastructure, such as servers and the network. Result \& Discussions: From the available literature the manufacturing phase is shown to dominate the life cycle of a {\textquotedblleft}typical{\textquotedblright} smartphone for GHG emissions. Smartphone users are shown to be increasingly reliant upon the internet for provision of their communications. Adding a server into the scope of a smartphone is shown to increase the use phase impact from 8.5 kgCO2-eq to 18.0 kgCO2-eq, other phases are less affected. Addition of the network increases the use phase by another 24.7 kgCO2-eq. In addition, it is shown that take-back of mobile phones is not effective at present and that prompt return of the phones could result in reduction in impact by best reuse potential and further reduction in toxic emissions through inappropriate disposal. Conclusions: The way in which consumers interact with their phones is changing, leading to a system which is far more integrated with the internet. A product service system based upon a cloud service highlights the need for improved energy efficiency to make greatest reduction in GHG emissions in the use phase, and gives a mechanism to exploit residual value of the handsets by timely return of the phones, their components and recovery of materials.}

	abstract = {Energy consumption is increasing in the IT sector and a remarkable part of this energy is consumed in data centers. Numerous techniques have been proposed to solve the energy efficiency issue in cloud systems. Recently, there are some efforts to decentralize the cloud via distributing data centers in diverse geographical positions. In this paper, we elaborate on the energy consumption of different cloud architectures, from a mega-datacenter to a P2P-cloud that provides extreme decentralization in terms of datacenter size. P2P-cloud is defined as a set of commodity host machines, connected to each other to serve a community. Our evaluation results reveal the fact that the more decentralized the system is, the less energy may be consumed in the system. Studying the energy efficiency of P2P-cloud infrastructure shows that the additional system design complexity involved is warranted with improved energy-efficiency and better locality for some services. Our analysis indicates that such P2P-cloud outperforms the classic datacenter model as long as it meets the locality conditions, which are commonplace in communities. Moreover, we illustrate how much energy can be saved for MapReduce applications with a diverse range of specifications by switching to P2P-cloud.},

It introduces an approach that takes into account the whole life-cycle of products and materials and not only the waste phase. Member States shall take appropriate steps to focus on reducing the environmental impacts of waste generation and waste management, thereby strengthening the economic value of waste. Furthermore, the recovery of waste and the use of recovered materials should be encouraged in order to conserve natural resources. In order to ensure the protection of the environment, provisions have been made for a system of permits for undertakings which treat, store or tip waste on behalf of third parties, for a supervisory system for undertakings which dispose of their own waste and for those which collect the waste of others, and for a plan embracing the essential factors to be taken into consideration in respect of the various waste disposal operations.

	title = {Breaking Barriers on Reuse of Digital Devices Ensuring Final Recycling},
	year = {2015},
	note = {Best paper award},
	abstract = {Digital Devices or Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE) are scrapped at an alarming rate instead of being salvaged, fixed, and reused. For the reuse sector to flourish, donors, receivers, and reuse centers need services and technologies to gain effectiveness, efficiency, and traceability to reach the goal of greatly extending the lifetime of devices and still ensuring their final recycling. The main challenges to overcome are access to sufficient good-quality used devices, quick preparation of those with greatest potential for reuse, ability to make direct donations, guarantee that reused devices are eventually recycled, communication of the social and environmental value of reuse, establishing a system to reward donors, and ensuring commitment of receivers of reused devices to recycling. We present a set of open-source tools based on a distributed platform ecosystem that supports direct donation of devices. Devices are prepared for reuse in the donor's location, and receivers collect them. Malicious users are discouraged by a reputation scheme to reward cooperative receivers that reuse devices and track them until disposed to recycling agents. This reduces costs, and minimizes EEE losses as there is no need for a central logistic system or centralizing the engagement of donors on charity projects. The background and foreground Intellectual Property follows an open model (unrestricted), as the goal is to bootstrap the reuse process, generate local efficiencies, guarantee final recycling, and ensure traceability. Pilots already performed for more than four years and two thousand devices validate the model with 80\% traceability of device components. },
